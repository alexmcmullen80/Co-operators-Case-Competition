## Instructions to Run the Code

1. **Download the entire folder** to your local machine.

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
   - Navigate to the folder where the project is located.
   - Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:

     ### On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

     ### On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Run the code**:
   - Once the virtual environment is activated, run the following command in your terminal to start the application:
   
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

The code is contained within the `app.py` file, and once the environment is activated, you can execute it directly.
